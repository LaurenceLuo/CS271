Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 

Guidelines for compiling and running:

Dancing Link:
1) Open Hexadoku_DL.cpp 
2) Locate main function, uncomment the line with the label of benchmarks to be compiled.
3) Under Linux environment, use the compile line:
	g++ Hexadoku_DL.cpp -o hexadoku_dl
4) Run the file using the compile line:
	./hexadoku_dl
5) The results will be printed in the terminal
6) For other benchmarks, the procedure is similar(comment the original line and uncomment the label of benchmarks you want to execute. Then compile and run)

Backtracking:
1) Open Hexadoku.cpp 
2) Locate main function, uncomment the line with the label of benchmarks to be compiled.
3) Under Linux environment, use the compile line:
	g++ Hexadoku.cpp -o hexadoku
4) Run the file using the compile line:
	./hexadoku
5) The results will be printed in the terminal
6) For other benchmarks, the procedure is similar(comment the original line and uncomment the label of benchmarks you want to execute. Then compile and run)
Node that for hexa-20,50,80,81,82, it will take hours to run.
